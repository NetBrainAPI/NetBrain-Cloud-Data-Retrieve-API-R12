The Status Check Failed metric is an important indicator used to monitor the health and performance of your EC2 instances. It reports whether the instance has passed both the instance status check and the system status check.



This API is integrated into the AWS Ec2 instance in NetBrain. It corresponds with the `get_metric_data` function of the CloudWatch resource in the AWS REST API.
