In AWS Classic Load Balancer (CLB), the metric for tracking HTTP 4xx responses generated by the load balancer itself (rather than the backend instances). This API provides the number of HTTP 4xx client error codes generated by the load balancer. These errors occur when the client sends a request that is invalid or cannot be fulfilled by the load balancer.

This API is integrated into the AWS Classic Loadbalancer in NetBrain. It corresponds with the `get_metric_data` function of the CloudWatch resource in the AWS REST API.
