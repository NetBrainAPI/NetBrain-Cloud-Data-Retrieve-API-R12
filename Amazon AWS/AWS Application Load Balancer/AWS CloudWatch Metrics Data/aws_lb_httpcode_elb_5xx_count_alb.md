The "HTTPCode_ELB_5XX_Count" metric in AWS is an important metric for monitoring the health and performance of your Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). It tracks the number of HTTP 5xx server error responses generated by the ELB, indicating issues that need to be addressed to ensure the reliability and availability of your application.

The API response contains the number of HTTP 5xx status codes that the load balancer returns to clients.

This API is integrated into the AWS Application Loadbalancer in NetBrain. It corresponds with the `get_metric_data` function of the CloudWatch resource in the AWS REST API.
