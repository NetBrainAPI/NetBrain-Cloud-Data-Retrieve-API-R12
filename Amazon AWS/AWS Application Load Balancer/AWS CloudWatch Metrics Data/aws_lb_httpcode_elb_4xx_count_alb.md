# Overview <a name="overview"></a>
The <b>HTTPCode_ELB_4XX_Count</b> metric for an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) tracks the number of HTTP 4XX (Client Error) responses generated by the load balancer. Monitoring this metric helps identify instances where client requests are invalid or cannot be fulfilled, such as due to bad requests or unauthorized access attempts. Analyzing 4XX responses helps in troubleshooting client-side issues and enhancing the security of the application.

# Metric Info <a name="metric-info"></a>
* <b>Metric Name</b>: HTTPCode_ELB_4XX_Count   
* <b>Namespace</b>: AWS/ApplicationELB
* <b>Unit</b>: Count
* <b>Display Name in NetBrain</b>: HTTP Code ELB 4XX Count

# User-Defined Parameters <a name="user-defined-parameters"></a>
* <b>Start Time / End Time</b>: Specify the time range for viewing data points, useful for historical analysis or monitoring recent trends. Default time range is last 24 hours.
* <b>Statistics</b>: Default value is Sum.
  * <b>Average</b>: Tracks the average rate of 4XX responses, which can indicate general trends in client errors over time.
  * <b>Sum</b>: Shows the total number of 4XX responses, useful for understanding the frequency of client errors.
  * <b>Minimum</b>: Identifies the lowest count of 4XX errors within a specified period, which can help in understanding the baseline of client errors under minimal load or optimal conditions.
  * <b>Maximum</b>: Highlights peak periods with high client errors, which may indicate unusual activity or issues with request validation.
* <b>Period</b>: Default value is 300 second.
  * <b>Recommended Values</b>:
    * <b>300 seconds</b> for near real-time monitoring.
    * <b>3600 seconds</b> for broader trend analysis over longer durations.

# Use Cases Example <a name="example"></a>
## Use Case 1: Identifying Unauthorized Access Attempts <a name="example-1"></a>
Monitor HTTP Code ELB 4XX Count to detect instances where clients attempt to access restricted resources, helping in identifying unauthorized access attempts or misconfigured permissions.



## Use Case 2: Troubleshooting Client-Side Issues <a name="example-2"></a>
A high number of 4XX responses may indicate problems with client requests, such as incorrect URL paths or invalid parameters. Monitoring this metric helps in diagnosing and addressing these issues.
