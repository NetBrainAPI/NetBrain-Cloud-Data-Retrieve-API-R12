# Overview <a name="overview"></a>
The <b>HTTPCode_Target_3XX_Count</b> metric for an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) tracks the number of HTTP 3XX (Redirection) responses generated by the target groups behind the load balancer. This metric helps monitor redirection behaviors, which could occur due to routing or configuration issues, or when the backend targets are intentionally redirecting traffic to other resources.

# Metric Info <a name="metric-info"></a>
* <b>Metric Name</b>: HTTPCode_Target_3XX_Count   
* <b>Namespace</b>: AWS/ApplicationELB
* <b>Unit</b>: Count
* <b>Display Name in NetBrain</b>: HTTP Code Target 3XX Count

# User-Defined Parameters <a name="user-defined-parameters"></a>
* <b>Start Time / End Time</b>: Specify the time range for viewing data points, useful for historical analysis or monitoring recent trends. Default time range is last 24 hours.
* <b>Statistics</b>: Default value is Sum.
  * <b>Average</b>: Tracks the average number of 3XX responses over the period, helping to understand redirection behavior during different time frames.
  * <b>Sum</b>: Shows the total count of 3XX responses, useful for assessing the overall frequency of redirects across target groups.
  * <b>Minimum</b>: Identifies the lowest number of 3XX responses, providing insight into periods with minimal redirection activity.
  * <b>Maximum</b>: Highlights the peak count of 3XX responses, which could indicate unusual spikes or redirect loops.
* <b>Period</b>: Default value is 300 second.
  * <b>Recommended Values</b>:
    * <b>300 seconds</b> for near real-time monitoring.
    * <b>3600 seconds</b> for broader trend analysis over longer durations.

# Use Cases Example <a name="example"></a>
## Use Case 1: Analyzing Client Experience <a name="example-1"></a>
Monitor for frequent redirects, which could negatively affect client experience by introducing additional latency. Understanding redirection patterns helps to improve the user experience by optimizing backend routing.


## Use Case 2: Optimizing Backend Target Configuration <a name="example-2"></a>
High 3XX response counts may signal issues with how backend targets are configured or how they handle requests. This metric can help diagnose misconfigurations and optimize target behavior.
