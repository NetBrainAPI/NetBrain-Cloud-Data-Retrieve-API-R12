The "HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count" metric in AWS tracks the number of HTTP 5xx server error responses generated by the targets (such as EC2 instances, containers, or Lambda functions) behind your Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). This metric helps you identify and diagnose issues related to server-side errors.

The API response containsthe number of HTTP 5xx status codes returned by the targets registered with your load balancer.



This API is integrated into the AWS Application Loadbalancer in NetBrain. It corresponds with the `get_metric_data` function of the CloudWatch resource in the AWS REST API.
