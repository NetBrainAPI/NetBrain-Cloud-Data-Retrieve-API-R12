# Overview <a name="overview"></a>
The <b>HTTPCode_Target_4XX_Count</b> metric for an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) tracks the number of HTTP 4XX (Client Error) responses generated by the target groups behind the load balancer. This metric is valuable for identifying issues related to client-side errors, such as incorrect requests, bad input, or misconfigurations in the backend targets that are returning errors in response to client requests.

# Metric Info <a name="metric-info"></a>
* <b>Metric Name</b>: HTTPCode_Target_4XX_Count   
* <b>Namespace</b>: AWS/ApplicationELB
* <b>Unit</b>: Count
* <b>Display Name in NetBrain</b>: HTTP Code Target 4XX Count

# User-Defined Parameters <a name="user-defined-parameters"></a>
* <b>Start Time / End Time</b>: Specify the time range for viewing data points, useful for historical analysis or monitoring recent trends. Default time range is last 24 hours.
* <b>Statistics</b>: Default value is Sum.
  * <b>Average</b>: Tracks the average number of 4XX responses, helping to identify periods with frequent client-side errors.
  * <b>Sum</b>: Shows the total number of 4XX responses, useful for understanding how often client errors are occurring across target groups.
  * <b>Minimum</b>: Identifies the lowest number of 4XX responses, indicating periods when client errors were minimal.
  * <b>Maximum</b>: Highlights peak counts of 4XX responses, which may signal spikes in client-side issues or bad requests.
* <b>Period</b>: Default value is 300 second.
  * <b>Recommended Values</b>:
    * <b>300 seconds</b> for near real-time monitoring.
    * <b>3600 seconds</b> for broader trend analysis over longer durations.

# Use Cases Example <a name="example"></a>
## Use Case 1: Detecting Client-Side Errors <a name="example-1"></a>
Monitor <b>HTTPCode_Target_4XX_Count</b> to track when backend targets return 4XX errors, which could indicate issues such as invalid requests, unauthorized access attempts, or client misconfigurations.



## Use Case 2: Improving User Experience <a name="example-2"></a>
Frequent 4XX errors could negatively impact the user experience. Monitoring this metric helps to address client-side problems before they escalate, improving application reliability.
