# Overview <a name="overview"></a>
The <b>HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count</b> metric for an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) tracks the number of HTTP 5XX (Server Error) responses generated by the backend target groups. This metric is essential for identifying server-side issues where the backend targets fail to handle requests correctly, indicating problems such as server misconfigurations, overloads, or application failures.

# Metric Info <a name="metric-info"></a>
* <b>Metric Name</b>: HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count   
* <b>Namespace</b>: AWS/ApplicationELB
* <b>Unit</b>: Count
* <b>Display Name in NetBrain</b>: HTTP Code Target 5XX Count

# User-Defined Parameters <a name="user-defined-parameters"></a>
* <b>Start Time / End Time</b>: Specify the time range for viewing data points, useful for historical analysis or monitoring recent trends. Default time range is last 24 hours.
* <b>Statistics</b>: Default value is Sum.
  * <b>Average</b>: Tracks the average number of 5XX responses over a period, helping to identify when server-side errors are more frequent.
  * <b>Sum</b>: Shows the total number of 5XX responses, providing insight into how often the backend targets fail to handle requests.
  * <b>Minimum</b>: Highlights peak counts of 5XX errors, which may indicate significant failures or overloads.
  * <b>Maximum</b>: Highlights peak counts of 4XX responses, which may signal spikes in client-side issues or bad requests.
* <b>Period</b>: Default value is 300 second.
  * <b>Recommended Values</b>:
    * <b>300 seconds</b> for near real-time monitoring.
    * <b>3600 seconds</b> for broader trend analysis over longer durations.

# Use Cases Example <a name="example"></a>
## Use Case 1: Identifying Backend Failures <a name="example-1"></a>
Monitor HTTP Code Target 5XX Count to identify when backend servers are experiencing errors that prevent them from fulfilling requests. This metric helps pinpoint issues such as service crashes, application errors, or misconfigurations.




## Use Case 2: Diagnosing Application Failures <a name="example-2"></a>
Frequent 5XX errors often indicate issues with the application code or configuration. Use this metric to identify such failures and take corrective action to prevent service disruption.
