# Overview <a name="overview"></a>
The <b>HTTPCode_ELB_502_Count</b> metric tracks the number of HTTP 502 error codes generated by the load balancer. HTTP 502 errors indicate that the load balancer was unable to successfully forward the request to a backend target, often due to backend failures or misconfigurations. Monitoring this metric helps identify backend issues, such as overloaded targets or communication failures, that prevent the load balancer from properly processing requests.

# Metric Info <a name="metric-info"></a>
* <b>Metric Name</b>: HTTPCode_ELB_502_Count   
* <b>Namespace</b>: AWS/ApplicationELB
* <b>Unit</b>: Count
* <b>Display Name in NetBrain</b>: HTTP Code ELB 502 Count

# User-Defined Parameters <a name="user-defined-parameters"></a>
* <b>Start Time / End Time</b>: Specify the time range for viewing data points. This is useful for historical analysis or monitoring recent trends. The default time range is the last 24 hours.
* <b>Statistics</b>: Default value is Sum.
  * <b>Average</b>: The average number of 502 errors during the time period.
  * <b>Sum</b>: Total number of HTTP 502 errors returned by the load balancer.
  * <b>Minimum</b>: The least number of 502 errors in the selected period.
  * <b>Maximum</b>: The maximum number of 502 errors in the selected period.
* <b>Period</b>: Default value is 300 second.
  * <b>Recommended Values</b>:
    * <b>300 seconds</b> for near real-time monitoring.
    * <b>3600 seconds</b> for broader trend analysis over longer durations.

# Use Cases Example <a name="example"></a>
## Use Case 1: Backend Target Issues <a name="example-1"></a>
Monitor this metric to detect HTTP 502 errors, which often indicate that one or more backend targets are unreachable, unresponsive, or overloaded.



## Use Case 2: Load Balancer Health Monitoring <a name="example-2"></a>
Use this metric to track the health of the load balancer in relation to its ability to forward requests to backend services without errors, ensuring it is operating as expected.
