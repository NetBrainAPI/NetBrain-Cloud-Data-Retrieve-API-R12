A target group is a logical grouping of EC2 instances or hosts that receive traffic forwarded by a load balancer.



The <b>Describe Load Balancer Target Groups<b> API provides a list of all target groups within the specified region. The API response includes detailed information about each target group and its associated targets.



This API is part of the AWS VPC Router in NetBrain and corresponds to the `describe_target_groups` function of the AWS REST API.



For more details about the AWS rest API, please refer to the following AWS official document: https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/elbv2/client/describe_target_groups.html
