The "HTTPCode_Target_4XX_Count" metric in AWS is crucial for monitoring the number of client error responses generated by the targets (such as EC2 instances, containers, or Lambda functions) behind your Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). This metric helps identify issues related to client requests that result in errors at the target level.

The API response contains the number of HTTP 4xx status codes returned by the targets registered with your load balancer.



This API is integrated into the AWS Application Loadbalancer in NetBrain. It corresponds with the `get_metric_data` function of the CloudWatch resource in the AWS REST API.
