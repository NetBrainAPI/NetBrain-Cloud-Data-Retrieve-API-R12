The "HTTPCode_ELB_3XX_Count" metric in AWS measures the number of HTTP 3xx (redirection) responses generated by the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). This metric is useful for understanding the behavior and performance of your web applications, particularly in relation to URL redirection.

The API response contains the number of HTTP 3xx status codes that the load balancer returns to clients.



This API is integrated into the AWS Application Loadbalancer in NetBrain. It corresponds with the `get_metric_data` function of the CloudWatch resource in the AWS REST API.
